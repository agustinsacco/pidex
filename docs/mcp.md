# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

pi core deliberately excludes MCP; it arrives via the `pi-mcp-adapter`
package (declared in pi settings.json `packages`). MCP tools reach the chat
as ordinary `tool_execution_*` events, so the transcript needs nothing
special — pidex's job is **config management and status surfacing**.

## Settings → Connectors

**One tab, one list.** Connectors and MCP used to be two tabs, and they were
two views of the same thing: a connector IS an MCP server, and connecting one
writes the `pi-global` scope of the very chain the other tab resolved. The same
rows rendered twice with different affordances, and only the catalog view
carried the adapter's structured per-server state — so the tab that listed
_every_ server was the one that could not say whether any of them worked.

The list is now the resolved chain, enriched with catalog metadata wherever a
server's URL matches a known connector. Sections, in order:

1. **Connected** — one row per resolved server: scope badge, status chip,
   transport, **Test**, Sign in / Reconnect / Connect now (URL servers only),
   enable toggle, Edit, Remove. Plus cached-tool disclosure, shadow notes, and a warning when
   `directTools` is set, since that opts the server out of the `mcp` gateway
   and costs its full schema on every request. Rendered FIRST on purpose.
2. **Add a connector** — the curated catalog, minus anything already
   configured. This is an add affordance, not a separate world.
3. **Advanced** (collapsed) — adapter install state and the chain file list
   with the raw JSON editor. Repair tools, not daily controls.

Six curated OAuth
connectors — Linear, Notion, Braintrust, Datadog, Fellow, Slack — each with the
endpoint checked against the vendor's docs, because a wrong URL fails as
"broken auth" (`src/features/connectors/catalog.ts`; endpoints and their
gotchas are documented per entry there).

**"Is it up?" is a button, not an inference.** The status chip comes from the
adapter inside a live session, so with nothing open the row could only say
`state unknown`, and with a session it said `Signed in · idle` — true, and
silent about whether the server answers right now. **Test** runs the adapter's
own `/mcp reconnect <server>` in a throwaway
`pi --mode rpc --no-session` (`electron/pi/connector-check.ts`, IPC
`mcp:checkServer`), which closes the connection, opens a fresh one, and
reports the outcome as a notify. `shared/connectors.ts`
`parseReconnectNotice` turns that line into a verdict — `Up · N tools`,
`Needs sign-in`, `Down`, `Disabled`, `Not in config` — and the row prefers it
over the status chip, because a fresh reconnect is stronger evidence than the
last snapshot. It fails closed: anything unrecognised, refused or timed out is
`Test inconclusive`, never a wrong up-or-down. No model runs, so a test spends
no tokens.

Three rules hold this together:

1. **pidex never holds a connector token.** The adapter does PKCE, dynamic
   client registration, a loopback callback on `localhost:19876/callback` and
   token custody in the OS credential store. pidex writes `mcp.json` and
   nothing else. Two copies of a refresh token means one is always stale.
2. **Auth is actuated by the adapter's own command,** `/mcp-auth <server>`. pi
   runs extension commands immediately without an LLM call, so connecting
   spends **no tokens**. Disconnect is `/mcp logout`, reconnect is
   `/mcp reconnect`. Deep-importing the adapter's auth module is not an option:
   only `./oauth` (read tokens) is in its `exports` map, and the package is
   versioned independently of pidex.
   There are two routes to that command, and the difference is which process
   runs it:
   - **Headless** (`mcp:authorize`, the default): main spawns a throwaway
     `pi --mode rpc --no-session` (`electron/pi/connector-auth.ts`), drives the
     flow, opens the browser itself, and kills the process when it settles.
     `--no-session` matters twice — no session file appears in the sidebar, and
     the process is never in the registry, so nothing projects it as work. Progress arrives on the `mcp:authState` broadcast. This is what makes
     Settings usable on a fresh launch, which is when people go there.
   - **In-session**: the adapter auto-authenticates mid-turn when a model calls
     a tool whose server has no token, so the same prompt can arrive on a live
     session's extension-UI channel. `stores/extensionUi.ts` routes it to the
     same store and the same card.
3. **pidex never auto-answers the adapter's authorization prompt.** The adapter
   asks for the callback URL through `ctx.ui.input`, and pidex claims that
   request (`stores/extensionUi.ts` → `stores/connectors.ts`), opens the
   browser and shows a card. pi's RPC has **no server→client cancel**, so when
   the loopback callback wins the race the adapter abandons its prompt silently
   — and an empty or cancelled answer sent "to tidy up" wins that race instead
   and throws `OAuth authentication cancelled`, killing a flow that already
   succeeded. A pending request is left pending; only an explicit user Cancel
   answers it. The interception is global, not scoped to Settings, because the
   adapter also auto-authenticates mid-turn when a model calls a tool whose
   server has no token.

Slack is the one connector that cannot be one click, and its row carries the
whole reason why. Slack has no dynamic registration, so the user registers an
app and pastes its **client id**. Slack also refuses a `http://localhost`
redirect URL unless that app has **PKCE** enabled, and a PKCE app is a _public_
client whose token exchange carries no secret — so the secret field is
optional, and an empty one is never written (the adapter reads any secret as
`client_secret_post`). The registered redirect URI pins the callback port:
default `19876`, `MCP_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT` overrides it.

Two more Slack rules the row states, both of which fail late and confusingly:
only **internal or Marketplace-published** apps may use MCP at all, and the
app's declared user scopes must cover what pidex asks for. The row's "Set up
the app" disclosure hands over an app manifest that sets the scopes, the
redirect URL and `pkce_enabled` in one paste, and the catalog writes
`oauth.scope` from the same list (`SLACK_USER_SCOPES`) — with no scope
configured the MCP SDK asks for every scope in the server's
protected-resource metadata, and Slack fails the whole authorization for any
scope the app does not declare.

## The Claude provider reaches MCP through pi, not around it

A `pi-claude-cli` session has **two** possible sources of MCP servers, and only
one of them is pidex's.

1. **pi's chain** (the table below), loaded by the adapter, which registers
   `mcp` / `mcpScript` into pi's tool registry. pi-claude-cli then snapshots
   every non-built-in pi tool into a schema-only MCP server it hands the CLI as
   `--mcp-config`, so the gateway arrives as `mcp__custom-tools__mcp`. The
   schema server answers `initialize` and `tools/list` only: a call is bounced
   back to pi, which executes the real tool and resumes the CLI next turn.
2. **The Claude CLI's own chain** — `~/.claude/.mcp.json`, `~/.claude.json`,
   and the user's claude.ai account connectors. pidex neither writes nor reads
   these.

Servers from (2) are a problem, not a bonus. They never become pi
`tool_execution_*` events (only `mcp__custom-tools__*` does), so
`worktree-paths.ts` cannot guard them; the footer chip and the context meter
both read the adapter, which knows nothing about them; and the same project
behaves differently on two machines. So every Claude-provider spawn gets
`PI_CLAUDE_CLI_STRICT_MCP=1` (`claudeProviderSpawnEnv` in
`electron/pi/provider-detect.ts`), which passes the CLI `--strict-mcp-config`
and drops chain (2) entirely.

Not `PI_CLAUDE_CLI_HERMETIC`: it reaches the same flag but also passes an empty
`--setting-sources`, which drops the CLI's CLAUDE.md auto-memory. pidex already
passes `--no-context-files` so pi omits its own copy, and the pair would leave
the model with project instructions from neither side.

**Requires pi-claude-cli >= 0.5.1.** Older versions ignore the variable and
keep the pre-existing merge. That release also refreshes the schema snapshot
per turn; before it, the tool surface froze at turn 1, so a connector added
mid-session never reached the model until the session restarted.

The gateway is also what keeps a session small: `mcp` + `mcpScript` cost ~3.9KB
of schema no matter how many servers are configured, growing only by the server
names listed in the `mcp` description. `directTools` on a server entry opts out
of that — it promotes that server's tools to flat top-level names, which is
worth ~80KB of schema for a server like Linear.

## Per-server status

`pi-ext/mcp-status.ts` forwards the adapter's `pi-mcp-adapter/status/v1`
snapshots to the renderer under status key `pidex-mcp-status`
(`src/features/connectors/mcpStatus.ts`). That is the only structured source of
per-server state: connected / needs-auth / failed / cached / disabled /
not-connected, plus tool and resource counts. It needs a live session, since
the adapter runs inside one — with no session a connector row reads
“state unknown” rather than inventing one. Signing in does **not** need a
session; only observing state does.

The session footer renders it as a chip (`MCP 2/3 · 48 tools`) that opens
Settings → Connectors; the context meter attributes MCP schema cost per server.

## Config chain (adapter-documented, lowest → highest)

| Scope        | File                                                               |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `xdg`        | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp/mcp.json` (default `~/.config/mcp/mcp.json`) |
| `agents`     | `~/.agents/mcp.json`                                               |
| `agents-dir` | `~/.agents/mcp/mcp.json`                                           |
| `pi-global`  | `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` (honors `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`)              |
| `project`    | `<workspace>/.mcp.json`                                            |
| `pi-project` | `<workspace>/.pi/mcp.json`                                         |

Shape: `{"mcpServers": {name: {url | command+args+env, directTools?, disabled?}}}`.
Later files win per server name; pidex records shadowed scopes.

## Rules

- **Renderer sends scope enums, never paths** — path resolution lives in
  `electron/pi/mcp-config.ts` only. Writes are limited to `pi-global` /
  `pi-project` for new servers; disable/remove target the server's own file.
- Malformed files are surfaced (never overwritten by structured writes); a
  raw JSON escape-hatch editor covers repair, and validates JSON on save.
- Structured mutations preserve unknown keys (mutate the parsed object).
- Exactly one of `url` / `command` per server; names refuse path separators.

## Status honesty

There is no structured per-server liveness source **other than the status
extension above**, and that requires a live session. Without one the tab
shows:

1. **Installed** — read from `packages:list` (per-scope; pi loads both, so
   the merged settings view would misreport). One-click install runs
   `packages:run` — pi's own package manager, streamed — with a "restart
   sessions to apply" note. Full package management: [12-extensions.md](extensions.md).
2. **Session line** — the adapter's `setStatus` footer text for the active
   session, ANSI-cleaned, labeled as adapter-reported.
3. **Cached tools** — `~/.pi/agent/mcp-cache.json`, parsed tolerantly,
   labeled "cached".

## Code map

- Types: `shared/mcp.ts`. Main: `electron/pi/mcp-config.ts` (injectable dirs
  for hermetic tests: `electron/pi/mcp-config.test.ts`).
- IPC: `mcp:readConfigs / upsertServer / removeServer / setDisabled /
readCache / readFile / writeFile`, plus `mcp:authorize /
mcp:submitAuthCallback / mcp:cancelAuth / mcp:checkServer` and the
  `mcp:authState` broadcast
  (`electron/ipc/mcp-handlers.ts`). The in-session route adds no IPC — it
  drives pi over the existing `piCommand` path and `app:openExternal`.
- Connectors: `shared/connectors.ts` (the adapter's prompt/verdict parsers,
  shared because main and renderer both read them),
  `src/features/connectors/` (`catalog.ts`, `mcpStatus.ts`),
  `src/stores/connectors.ts`, `electron/pi/connector-auth.ts`,
  `electron/pi/connector-check.ts` (the headless connection test),
  `src/features/connectors/FlowCard.tsx` (the OAuth round-trip card),
  `src/features/connectors/ServerEditor.tsx` (the add/edit form),
  `pi-ext/mcp-status.ts`.
- UI: one tab, `src/features/settings/tabs/ConnectorsTab.tsx` — resolved
  server rows (scope badge, status chip, enable toggle, cached tool
  disclosure, directTools warning, shadow notes, OAuth flow card), the
  catalog add rows, the add/edit form, and an Advanced disclosure holding the
  adapter card and the chain file list with its raw editor. Mock cases in
  `src/dev/mockPidex.ts`.
- E2E: `e2e/smoke.spec.ts` "Connectors: resolved rows" — seeds `agentDir/mcp.json`,
  asserts the resolved row, toggles disable (file gains `"disabled": true`),
  adds a project server (`.pi/mcp.json` written). "Connectors" — adds Datadog
  on the EU site and asserts the written endpoint, since a per-site host that
  silently defaults to US authorizes and then returns nothing. “Connectors:
  signing in works with no session open” drives the headless flow against the
  stub, which answers `/mcp-auth` with the adapter's real prompt shape, then
  clicks **Test** and asserts the `Up · 7 tools` verdict the stub's
  `/mcp reconnect` reply produces.
