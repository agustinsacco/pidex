# Spec drift audit — every living contract vs. the code

Written 2026-08-30. Scope: all 14 files in [`reference/`](../reference/), plus
the open boxes in [`TRACKER.md`](../TRACKER.md) and the status columns in the
other three `backlog/` files. Method: read each doc in full, then verify every
claim it makes about a file name, a count, or a behaviour against the code.

**Why this file exists.** `reference/` is the folder the repo tells you to
trust, and the rule is that the code disagreeing with it makes _the doc_ wrong.
That rule has not been enforced in a while: 44 claims across 9 of the 14 docs
describe a pidex that no longer exists — layouts never built, tools with
different signatures, tabs that were added and never written down. Two docs
(`style-guide.md`, `mcp.md`) verified clean end to end, and `worktrees.md` and
`updates.md` verified clean apart from nothing.

Every row below is `open` unless it says otherwise. Fix a row in the same PR
that fixes the doc, and delete this file when it reaches zero.

## How to read the severity column

- **wrong** — the doc states something the code contradicts. A reader acting on
  it is misled.
- **missing** — the code has a real surface the doc never mentions. Less
  dangerous, still drift.
- **stale** — was true, has been overtaken (usually a shipped item still listed
  as to-build).

Not a spec bug but adjacent: **`CLAUDE.md` is the file that is wrong on the
extension count** ("ships seven … the bundled six"). It is six files, five
bundled. `specs/README.md:40` and the `extensions.md` table are both right.

All 14 fixed in the same PR that raised them. The tool table is now enforced
by `pi-ext/orchestrator-doc.test.ts`, which reads the doc and fails when a
tool's arguments stop matching the schema the extension registers — five of
the ten rows were wrong when the guard was written.

Verified accurate and worth keeping: the three modes and their capability
matrix, call-time enforcement through `BridgeDeps.modeFor` (`bridge.ts:50-58`),
the sentinel control channel and its 20s timeout, the prefs defaults and the
`orchestratorModeOf` migration, all ten tool names, and the fleet reducer's
160-char `lastLine` and 50-path caps.

## Status corrections elsewhere

These are not `reference/` drift — they are status fields in the tracking files
that no longer match the code. Corrected in this PR where the fix is one line;
the rest are rows to work.

## What this says about the process

The repo already has the right rule — _"if the change makes a `reference/` file
wrong, that file is part of the same diff, not a follow-up"_. Every row above
is an instance of it not being followed. Two patterns account for most of them:

1. **Aspirational text was never demoted.** `ui-shell.md` and `chat.md` still
   read like the build plan they were promoted from. Nine of their sixteen rows
   describe features nobody ever built, not features that changed.
2. **Signatures drift silently.** The orchestrator's ten tools have no
   compile-time link to the doc that describes them, unlike `shared/rpc.ts`,
   which has drift guards and is the one integration doc that verified clean.
   If any single fix is worth more than the rest, it is generating the tool
   table in `orchestration.md` from `bridge.ts` — or asserting it in a test.
