# Updates

How a running pidex learns about a new release and installs it. The release
pipeline that produces those artifacts is
[.github/workflows/release-continuous.yml](../../.github/workflows/release-continuous.yml);
this document covers only the client half.

Everything here is **hard-gated on `app.isPackaged`**. Dev runs, the browser
harness and the Playwright suite must never reach the network for an update
check, and `electron-updater` is imported lazily so an unpackaged run does not
even load it.

## Three paths, chosen once at startup

`resolveUpdatePath()` in [electron/updates/updater.ts](../../electron/updates/updater.ts)
picks one and caches it. The answer cannot change while the process runs.

| Path       | When                                              | What a click does                   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `updater`  | `pidexSigned` **and** (signed macOS \| AppImage)  | `electron-updater` `quitAndInstall` |
| `mac-self` | unsigned macOS, bundle writable, not translocated | swap the bundle, relaunch           |
| `manual`   | anything else (`.deb`, read-only bundle)          | open the releases page              |

`pidexSigned` is stamped into the packaged `package.json` by CI, not probed at
runtime, so the UI knows before the first check whether it can promise a
restart. It is `true` for every Linux build (AppImage self-updates with no
signing requirement) and only for macOS builds where `MAC_CERT_P12` was set.

**A `.deb` is deliberately `manual`.** The package manager owns those files.

## Why macOS needs its own installer

`MacUpdater` delegates to Electron's `autoUpdater`, i.e. Squirrel.Mac, which
validates the downloaded bundle against the **running** app's designated
requirement. pidex ships ad-hoc signed — there is no Developer ID; see
[2026-08-24-mac-adhoc-signing.md](../log/2026-08-24-mac-adhoc-signing.md) — and
an ad-hoc requirement is a per-build `cdhash`. That validation can never pass.
Setting `pidexSigned=true` for macOS would trade "opens a browser" for "errors
silently".

So [electron/updates/mac-installer.ts](../../electron/updates/mac-installer.ts)
does by hand what `scripts/install.sh` does by shell:

1. Read `latest-mac.yml`, pick the zip matching `process.arch`. The manifest
   lists x64 first and its top-level `path:` points there, so the arch test
   must be two-sided — "first zip wins" silently installs Intel on Apple
   silicon.
2. Download it and check the manifest's base64 `sha512`. A mismatch aborts.
3. Expand with `ditto -x -k`, **not `unzip`** — ditto is what preserves the
   symlinks, permissions and xattrs the bundle's signature is computed over.
4. Strip `com.apple.quarantine`, then `codesign --verify --deep --strict` and
   confirm `CFBundleShortVersionString` matches the expected version. A bundle
   that fails here never reaches `/Applications`.
5. On the user's click: two renames, then relaunch.

Staging lives **beside the installed bundle**, not in `/tmp`, so step 5 is two
atomic same-volume renames rather than a multi-second copy that can half-fail.
If the second rename throws, the first is undone and the running app is
untouched.

## The relaunch must wait for the old process

[electron/main.ts](../../electron/main.ts) holds a single-instance lock, and
`before-quit` SIGTERMs every pi child, kills the PTYs and closes the watchers
before quitting. A replacement that starts too early takes the
`second-instance` path, focuses the window that is already dying, and exits —
leaving the user with no app.

`spawnRelauncher` therefore writes a detached `/bin/sh` script that polls
`kill -0` on our pid (bounded at 60s), deletes the backup bundle, and only then
runs `/usr/bin/open -n`. `open` rather than exec'ing the binary directly, so
LaunchServices registers the new process and gives it a Dock tile.

Paths reach that script as positional arguments. Nothing from the network is
interpolated into a shell string anywhere in this module.

## Orphan sweep

A crash or force-quit between "extracted" and "swapped" strands several hundred
MB beside the app. `sweepOrphans` runs once at startup — the only moment we
know no swap is in flight — and removes entries matching exactly
`.pidex-update-<pid>-<stamp>` or `.pidex-old-<pid>-<stamp>.app` in the bundle's
own parent directory. A bare prefix test is not enough: this is `rm -rf` next
to a user's `/Applications`.

## What an update does NOT touch

Nothing persistent lives inside the bundle, so a swap resets no state:

- `~/Library/Application Support/pidex/config.json` — every pref. Its location
  derives from the app **name**, not the bundle path.
- `~/Library/Logs/pidex/` — the debug log.
- `~/.pi/`, `~/.claude/` — pi's sessions and settings, the Claude provider's
  transcripts.
- `<workspace>/.pi/`, `<workspace>/.mcp.json`, `<workspace>/.pidex/`.
- MCP OAuth tokens. The adapter owns those in the OS credential store, and a
  keychain ACL binds to the accessing process — which is `pi`, not `pidex.app`.

The only bundle-internal thing read at runtime is `process.resourcesPath/pi-ext`,
the shipped extension sources, which the new version _should_ replace.

Two consequences that are inherent, not bugs:

- **macOS may re-prompt for TCC permissions.** Ad-hoc signing gives a new
  `cdhash` per build. `install.sh` already replaces the bundle the same way, so
  this is not new behaviour.
- **An in-flight turn is lost on restart.** pi writes a session file only when
  a turn ends.

## The state machine

[electron/updates/update-state.ts](../../electron/updates/update-state.ts) is a
pure reducer, so every transition is unit tested without a packaged app or a
network. Phases: `idle`, `checking`, `downloading`, `installing`, `downloaded`,
`manual-download`, `unsupported`.

`installing` is macOS-only — `electron-updater` extracts inside its own
progress events.

Three rules the reducer enforces:

- **A failed check is never surfaced.** `error` collapses to `idle`. Offline is
  not the user's problem to solve, and must not nag.
- **Work in flight is never interrupted.** `check-started` and
  `update-not-available` are ignored while downloading, installing, or staged;
  the 30-minute timer will land mid-download sooner or later.
- **A failed self-install degrades to `manual-download`, not to silence.**
  `install-failed` carries the release URL, so the user keeps a way out.

`checkForUpdates` also guards re-entry with a flag: a macOS download takes
minutes and the timer would otherwise start a second one on top of it.

## Surfaces

- `UpdatePill` (sidebar footer) renders only `downloading`, `installing`,
  `downloaded`, `manual-download`. Only the last two are clickable, because
  only those can do anything.
- Settings → About has a **Check now** row. Until it existed, `updates:check`
  had no caller on any surface, and there was no way to ask "am I current?"
  while the pill was hidden.
