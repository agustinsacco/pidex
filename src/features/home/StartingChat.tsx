/**
 * The chat you just sent, before it has a session behind it.
 *
 * Stands in for `ChatView` for the few hundred milliseconds between Enter and
 * a live pi process. Its whole job is continuity: the message sits in the same
 * bubble, at the same width, in the same place it will occupy in the real
 * transcript, so when `activeSessionId` flips nothing on screen moves. Compare
 * the previous behaviour, where the home screen stayed up with the text still
 * in the composer and a 14px spinner as the only sign anything had happened.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the real transcript with a fake session id: the chat store
 * is keyed by pidexId, and inventing one would mean reconciling a placeholder
 * with the real session's items a moment later. A read-only echo has none of
 * that risk.
 *
 * Layout classes are copied from `MessageList` (`mx-auto max-w-3xl px-6`) and
 * `UserMessage` (`bg-user-bubble … rounded-xl px-4 py-2.5 text-lg`) rather
 * than shared: they are two files that must agree, and a shared wrapper would
 * put a component boundary inside the transcript's virtualised list for the
 * sake of one echo.

        unlabelled spinner in a window that has otherwise gone quiet reads as
