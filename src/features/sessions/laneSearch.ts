/**
 * Matching for the sidebar's per-workspace lane search.
 *
 * A lane is found by whichever of its three identities the reader remembers:
 * the title pidex gave it, the branch it runs on, or the PR it became. So the
 * haystack is all three, and a query term may land in any of them.
 *
 * Substring, not subsequence. `lib/fuzzy.ts` is a subsequence matcher, and on
 * branch-shaped text a three-letter query matches nearly every lane — which
 * reads as a filter that did nothing. Terms are ANDed and order-free, so
 * `130 rebase` and `rebase 130` find the same lane.
 *
 * Pure and React-free; `Sidebar.tsx` is the only consumer.
