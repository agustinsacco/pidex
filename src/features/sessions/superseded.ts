/**
 * Drop session files that a rewind left behind.
 *
 * pi's `fork` RPC — the one mechanism behind the per-message rewind button,
 * the fork picker and `clone` — never truncates a session in place. It copies
 * the entries up to the branch point into a brand-new `TIMESTAMP_ID.jsonl`,
 * moves the live runtime onto it, and abandons the original
 * (`createBranchedSession` in pi's `session-manager.js`). The abandoned file
 * stays on disk, so the sidebar showed two rows with the same name in the same
 * worktree after every rewind, which read as the lane having duplicated
 * itself. PR #144 fixed which of the two was marked live; this removes the
 * dead one.
 *
 * A branch is identified by BOTH halves, because `parentSession` alone is
 * ambiguous — pi records it for a plain successor session (`/new`) too, and
 * hiding the predecessor of a `/new` would delete real history from the
 * sidebar. Only a branch repeats its parent's first entry id, since only a
 * branch copies those entries.
 *
 * The file itself is untouched: this is presentation. Deleting a session
 * stays the user's call, and the bytes are still there for anyone who goes
 * looking.
 *
 * A LIVE session is never dropped. `bootstrapSession` relearns the branch's
 * path asynchronously, so for a moment after a rewind the abandoned file is
 * still the one a pi subprocess is claimed to own — hiding the row the user
 * is looking at, even briefly, is worse than showing one extra.
