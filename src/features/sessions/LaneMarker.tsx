/**
 * The emoji slot pinned left of a lane's title.
 *
 * Fixed width and ALWAYS rendered, including when the lane's marker is empty.
 * A slot that collapses on an unmarked lane shifts every title in the list, so
 * the left edge goes ragged and the eye has to re-find the title on each row —
 * which is the thing the marker column exists to prevent. An explicitly
 * cleared marker therefore renders a faint placeholder, not nothing.
