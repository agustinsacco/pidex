/**
 * How a session's title should be presented while its real name is decided.
 *
 * A chat now starts before it is named — the branch is cut from a slug of the
 * first message so pi can spawn immediately, and the generated title arrives
 * ~13s later (see docs/log/2026-08-22-fast-session-start.md). That leaves two
 * moments worth showing rather than hiding:
 *
 * - `pending`: the title on screen is provisional. Shimmered, not skeletoned —
 *   it is real readable text, just not final. The top bar's title and both
 *   sidebar row types shimmer; the branch chip is the one consumer that only
 *   uses `pending` for its tooltip and leaves the motion alone, which keeps a
 *   single naming event from lighting up four animations at once. See
 *   `.name-pending` in index.css.
 * - `settled`: for one short beat after the real name lands, so the swap reads
 *   as an arrival instead of a glitch. The user is several seconds past having
 *   asked for anything by then, so this is deliberately brief and small.
 *
 * Shared by the sidebar row, the top bar and the branch chip so all three
 * describe the same moment the same way. Both hooks read `stores/naming.ts`
 * and nothing else — see the note there on why that store is separate.
