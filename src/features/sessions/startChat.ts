/**
 * Starting a chat from the home composer: branch it, run it, name it.
 *
 * A chat that edits files wants its own branch, and pi never titles a session,
 * so pidex asks a one-shot `pi -p` for a name and derives the branch from it —
 * one chat, one branch, one name.
 *
 * The ORDER of those three is the whole design, and it is the opposite of what
 * it was. Naming used to run first, because the branch is named after the
 * title and a pi session is bound to the cwd it spawns in (it records its
 * transcript under a mangling of that path), so there is no moving a live
 * session into a worktree afterwards — the branch genuinely has to exist
 * before pi spawns.
 *
 * But `pi -p` is a whole agent boot: measured at ~6s before the model is even
 * asked anything, ~13s for a real naming prompt. Blocking the send button on
 * that made "new chat" read as a hang, and — because the wait was capped at
 * 12s — the title lost its own race every single time, so every auto-created
 * branch was in fact named after a slug of the first message and the generated
 * name arrived only via a SECOND ~13s call. Two model calls, ~26s, no title.
 *
 * So the dependency is inverted instead: the branch is cut immediately from a
 * slug of the first message, pi spawns and starts inference right away, and
 * the title is generated off the critical path. When it lands it sets the
 * session name and renames the branch to match (`git branch -m` is safe on a
 * branch a worktree has checked out; the folder keeps its slug, because moving
 * it would move a live session's cwd). The names still agree — a few seconds
 * later than before, having actually arrived rather than timed out.
 *
 * Every step still degrades instead of aborting: an unreachable remote falls
 * back to local trunk, a git refusal starts a plain session in the open folder
 * with the reason shown, and a failed naming leaves the slug in place. The
 * user's message is never lost to a failure in any of this.
 *
 * **None of the naming above actually ran until 2026-08-26.** The handler
 * behind `pi:generateTitle` used `execFile`, which leaves the child's stdin an
 * open pipe, and `pi -p` waits for stdin EOF — so every request sat idle until
 * its 30s timeout and returned null, silently, with empty stdout and empty
 * stderr. No session was ever auto-named and no branch was ever renamed; the
 * only visible symptom was that every branch kept its message slug. Fixed in
 * electron/pi/print-mode.ts, which spawns with stdin ignored. Read the note
 * there before touching that spawn.
