/**
 * Rewind semantics come straight from pi's own `fork` RPC command: it
 * branches the *live* session onto a new file rooted just before `entryId`
 * and hands back the original text, which the composer offers up for
 * edit-and-resend. This is the one mechanism behind both the per-message
 * "Rewind" button and the (multi-message) fork picker.
 *
 * pi always creates a new session file here, even though the live RPC
 * connection carries on uninterrupted on the same subprocess — so
 * `bootstrapSession` has to run again to relearn the new `sessionFile`.
 * Skipping that step leaves `live[sessionId].diskPath` pointed at the
 * abandoned pre-fork file, which reads in the sidebar as the chat having
 * been duplicated (see `bootstrapSession`'s doc comment).
 *
 * `images` is supplied by the caller, not by pi: `fork` replies with
 * `selectedText` only (`extractUserMessageText` in pi's runtime drops every
 * non-text block), so the only surviving copy of what the user attached is
 * the one the transcript is already rendering. Without it, rewinding a
 * message that had a screenshot on it gave the text back and silently ate
 * the screenshot.
