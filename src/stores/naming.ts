/**
 * Which sessions are still waiting on a generated name.
 *
 * A chat now starts before it is named — the branch is cut from a slug of the
 * first message so pi can spawn immediately, and the title arrives ~13s later
 * (specs/log/2026-08-22-fast-session-start.md). The title, the top bar and the
 * branch chip all show provisional values in the meantime, so they need to
 * know that.
 *
 * **Its own store on purpose.** This lived in `stores/sessions.ts` first, which
 * is the busiest store in the app: the sidebar, the top bar and the resource
 * monitor all subscribe to it, so every naming flip re-rendered all of them.
 * That is not merely wasteful — an unrelated re-render landing between a
 * native checkbox toggle and React's `onChange` commit reverts a controlled
 * input to its previous value, which is exactly how it was caught (the
 * resource monitor's "include terminals" toggle started failing in e2e, twice
 * in two runs, and passed with this state disabled).
 *
 * Keyed pidexId → the workspace being named, rather than pidexId → boolean, so
 * the branch chip can ask "is anything in my folder being named?" without also
 * subscribing to the live-session map it would otherwise need to join against.
