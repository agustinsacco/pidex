 * Pull-request state per repo, projected from the `gh` CLI.
 *
 * Keyed by repo path rather than by session: a sidebar group is one repo (the
 * grouping already folds worktrees into their main checkout), and one
 * `gh:prsForRepo` call answers for every lane in it. A lane's PR is then joined
 * at render time through `gitByCwd[cwd].branch`, the same way the subtitle
 * already joins git info — `SessionMeta` has no branch field to hang this on.
 *
 * Every failure mode of `gh` is a normal state, not an error: not installed,
 * not authenticated, no GitHub remote. Those all land here as an empty map and
 * render as no chip. Nothing in this store surfaces a toast.
