/**
 * The chat that has been sent but does not exist yet.
 *
 * Pressing Enter on the home composer used to change nothing on screen: the
 * typed text stayed in the field, the greeting stayed up, and the only
 * feedback was a 14px spinner in the composer's corner — while `startChat`
 * resolved a start point, created a worktree and spawned pi. Even at ~350ms
 * warm that reads as a dropped keystroke, and the labels written to narrate
 * the wait ("Creating branch…") only ever reached `aria-label`.
 *
 * So the send is committed immediately instead: the composer clears, this
 * store holds the message, and the app renders it as a chat that is coming up
 * (`StartingChat`). When the session exists, `activeSessionId` flips and the
 * real transcript takes over — showing the same message, in the same bubble,
 * in the same place, so the swap is invisible.
 *
 * **`draft` is the other half of that bargain.** Committing the send unmounts
 * `WorkspaceHome`, which takes its `text`/`images` state with it — so if the
 * start then fails, the component that would restore what the user typed no
 * longer exists. The draft is parked here instead, and the freshly remounted
 * greeting screen picks it up.
 *
 * **Its own store, like `naming.ts`.** It changes several times per send and
 * is read by the app shell; `sessions.ts` is subscribed to by the sidebar,
 * the top bar and the resource monitor, and does not need to re-render for
 * any of this.
