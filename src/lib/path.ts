 *     a worktree anywhere on disk — but arrives over a batched `git:infoBatch`
 *     round trip, so it is `undefined` on the first paint of every surface.
 *  2. `knownRoot` — the repo `git worktree list` reported this folder under.
 *     The sidebar's worktree discovery already has it at the moment it learns
 *     the path, so passing it costs nothing and needs no round trip. Covers
 *     worktrees anywhere on disk, unlike step 3.
 *  3. The path shape `<repo>/.pidex/worktrees/<name>`, which needs no I/O and
 *     is true the moment the path exists. It only knows about worktrees pidex
 *     created, which is why it is the last fallback and not the primary.
 *
 * Without step 2, a worktree that is not under `.pidex/worktrees` (a sibling
 * folder, `.claude/worktrees/`, `/tmp`) opened its OWN sidebar group, headed
 * by the branch slug, for as long as `git:infoBatch` took to answer — a wall
 * of fake "workspaces" on every cold start.
 *
 * Without step 3 the identity flashed — or stuck, whenever git info for that
 * cwd never loaded — on the worktree folder's own basename. Those folders are
 * named after their branch, so the top bar read "hey-2" for the `pidex` repo.
