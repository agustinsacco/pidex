/**
 * Runaway-burn detection from session token stats.
 *
 * A provider can bill enormously while accomplishing nothing: a tool loop that
 * re-sends context it already delivered spends its whole budget on input and
 * cache tokens, and the only visible symptom is that the numbers climb. On
 * 2026-08-21 that pattern consumed ~46M tokens across three concurrent pidex
 * sessions in roughly twenty minutes, peaking at 3.5M tokens/minute, and
 * nothing in the stack remarked on it.
 *
 * Two signals together, because rate alone would flag any large-context
 * session for the crime of being large:
 *
 *   - RATE. Healthy minutes in the incident data ran 27k–200k billed tokens;
 *     the runaway burst ran 1.4M–3.5M. The thresholds sit in the gap.
 *   - CACHEWRITE ACCELERATION. Within the trailing window, the rate at which
 *     cacheWrite accumulates in the second half over the same rate in the
 *     first half.
 *
 * Why cacheWrite acceleration is the discriminator. A replay loop re-sends
 * context it has already delivered, so the prompt *prefix* changes on every
 * turn, the cache misses, and cacheWrite climbs — and climbs faster as the
 * replayed transcript grows. Healthy accumulation appends to a prefix that is
 * already cached, so cacheWrite per turn shrinks toward just the newly added
 * content. The pathology is compounding growth, and this measures exactly that.
 *
 * Why YIELD (output as a share of billed) was dropped as a gate. It does not
 * separate a loop from legitimate read-heavy work. Measured on three real
 * sessions:
 *
 *   session   yield   reality
 *   01a02bb0  0.50%   genuine runaway; the resume prompt grew 51x
 *   01a024eb  1.15%   10-hour mixed session, real work plus some replay
 *   01a02c8e  0.93%   completely healthy: read 12 large files in 13 calls
 *
 * The healthy session's yield sits *between* the two bad ones. Replaying
 * 01a02c8e's real timeline through the yield-gated detector shows "elevated"
 * from t+65s onward on a session that did exactly what was asked. A detector
 * that fires on healthy work gets ignored when it matters, so yield is now
 * reported for context and gates nothing.
 *
 * Over the same two clean timelines, replayed at every polling density from
 * one sample per model call up to thirteen, acceleration never exceeded 0.91
 * on the healthy session in any window that also cleared the rate gate, and
 * never fell below 2.86 on the runaway one. See `burnRate.test.ts`, which
 * holds both timelines as real measurements.
