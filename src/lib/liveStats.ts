import type { SessionStats, Usage } from '@shared/rpc'

/**
 * Live session stats from the event stream, replacing most of the
 * `get_session_stats` polling.
 *
 * The context meter used to climb live by polling on every completed
 * sub-step — MEASURED at ~26 round trips per user turn across 12 real
 * sessions (2 for a short chat, 91 for a tool-heavy run). Since pi 0.84.2,
 * `message_update` carries the streaming message's cumulative `usage` for
 * free, so the meter can climb from data already arriving and the poll can
 * retreat to turn boundaries.
 *
 * The accounting must match pi's, which was read from its source (0.84.4),
 * not guessed:
 *
 * - `message_update.usage` is the CURRENT MESSAGE's usage, cumulative as of
 *   the delta — not session-cumulative. pi emits one assistant message per
 *   tool hop, so summing deltas naively would multiply-count a turn.
 * - Session totals are therefore `base + current`: `base` is re-seeded from
 *   every authoritative `get_session_stats` answer and advanced by each
 *   `message_end`'s final usage; `current` is the streaming message.
 * - pi's own context estimate (`estimateContextTokens`) is the LAST assistant
 *   usage's `totalTokens || input+output+cacheRead+cacheWrite`, plus a
 *   trailing estimate that is zero while that message is the latest — which
 *   during streaming it always is. So the live meter uses exactly that
 *   formula against the context window the last poll reported.
 *
 * Capability is detected, not version-checked: pi < 0.84.2 sends no `usage`
 * on deltas, `hasUsageDeltas` stays false, and the caller keeps the old
 * per-sub-step polling. pidex does not control which pi is installed.
