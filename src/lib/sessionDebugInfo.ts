/**
 * A copyable pointer to everything a session wrote to disk.
 *
 * Debugging a pi session after the fact means reading two ledgers, not one:
 *
 *   - pi's own transcript, which carries per-message `usage` (the authoritative
 *     token and cost numbers), and
 *   - the provider's transcript, when the session ran on the Claude Code CLI.
 *     The CLI keeps its own parallel copy of the conversation, and comparing
 *     the two is what exposes duplication — a pi transcript of 473 KB against
 *     a CLI copy of 13.8 MB is the whole diagnosis of a re-send bug.
 *
 * Both live under mangled directory names that are tedious to derive by hand,
 * and the two harnesses mangle differently. This produces the paths and the
 * ids in one block, so "here's my session" is a paste rather than an
 * archaeology exercise.
