/**
 * Pacing for the streaming-text reveal.
 *
 * Measured problem, not a hunch: the Claude Code provider delivers prose in
 * ~93-character chunks every ~550ms (12 deltas for a 1,121-char answer;
 * gap p50 544ms, p90 594ms), because the CLI batches the API's SSE stream
 * into its own cadence. pi-native providers stream token-sized deltas tens
 * of milliseconds apart. Rendering each chunk on arrival is what made
 * Claude-provider turns land in harsh slabs — Claude desktop receives the
 * same coarse chunks and reads smoothly because the client paces the reveal.
 *
 * So pidex paces it too: text drains from the (exact, untouched) store into
 * view at a rate that aims to empty the backlog in about one upstream gap.
 * The rate is proportional to the backlog — big chunk arrives, reveal speeds
 * up; backlog nearly empty, it eases out — so the reveal never falls behind
 * a fast producer and never crawls after a slow one. Pure math here, no
 * timers and no React, so it can be unit-tested against recorded cadences.
