/**
 * pidex worktree-paths extension — loaded into every pidex session via
 * `pi --mode rpc -e <this file>`, alongside artifacts.ts and
 * context-breakdown.ts.
 *
 * The failure it exists to stop: a session running in a linked git worktree
 * reads a file out of the MAIN checkout instead of its own tree, and nothing
 * says so. The two are different branches, so the model reviews code that is
 * not the code it was asked about — silently, and confidently.
 *
 * How it happens (reproduced against session 01a02ca0, pi 0.84.2 on the
 * Claude Code CLI provider): pi's tools accept relative paths, but Claude
 * Code's tool discipline pushes the model to absolutise them, and it builds
 * the absolute path from what it believes the project root is rather than
 * from the cwd it was given. pidex's worktrees live at
 * `<repo>/.pidex/worktrees/<name>`, so the cwd literally contains the main
 * checkout as a prefix — trimming the `.pidex/worktrees/<name>` segment
 * yields a path that exists, opens, and returns another branch's code. In
 * that session one of two reads leaked exactly this way, with the model's
 * own reasoning naming the correct RELATIVE path first.
 *
 * So the guard is narrow by construction. It fires only when all of these
 * hold, which no legitimate read satisfies by accident:
 *   1. the session cwd is a linked worktree (there is a main checkout), and
 *   2. the requested path resolves outside the cwd, and
 *   3. it resolves inside that main checkout, and
 *   4. the same repo-relative path exists inside the cwd.
 * Reading pi's own docs, ~/.pi, /tmp, or a main-checkout file with no
 * counterpart in the worktree is untouched.
 *
 * What it cannot see: on the Claude Code provider only pi's own tools reach
 * this hook (the CLI's control protocol denies `mcp__custom-tools__*` so pi
 * executes them) — Claude Code's internal tools are allowed to run inside the
 * CLI and never touch pi's tool layer. Both observed sessions read through
 * pi's `read`; the prompt block in `electron/pi/workspace-prompt.ts` is the
 * only cover for the other path.
 *
 * It blocks rather than rewrites: a silent correction trades one invisible
 * behaviour for another, and the model's next move (re-read at the right
 * path) is cheap. Asking for the identical path a second time is honoured —
 * that is the escape hatch for genuinely wanting the main checkout's copy,
 * e.g. "diff my version against main".
 *
 * Imports resolve against pi's own runtime when it loads the extension.
