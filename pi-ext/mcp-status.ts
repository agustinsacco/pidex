/**
 * pidex mcp-status extension — bundled into every pidex session via
 * `pi --mode rpc -e <this file>`.
 *
 * The MCP adapter knows, per server, whether it is connected, needs
 * authorization, failed, or is serving cached metadata. It publishes that as a
 * structured snapshot on pi's shared extension event bus
 * (`state.statusEvents = pi.events` in the adapter's index.ts), but pi's RPC
 * has no channel for it, so a front-end can otherwise only read the adapter's
 * one-line footer sentence — which says nothing per server.
 *
 * This forwards the snapshot verbatim to pidex through `ctx.ui.setStatus`,
 * which pidex already routes per session. Nothing is inferred or reworded: if
 * the adapter is absent or an older version stops publishing, the status key
 * simply never appears and pidex's connector rows show no state rather than a
 * guess.
 *
 * Wire contract: status key `pidex-mcp-status`, JSON of the adapter's
 * `McpStatusSnapshot`. Consumer: `src/features/connectors/mcpStatus.ts`.
