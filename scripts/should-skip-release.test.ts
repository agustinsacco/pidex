 * prose-matching attempts each suppressed their own release:
 *
 *   1. Whole-message match: the commit that introduced the pipeline documented
 *      `[skip release]` in its body — v0.1.37 never shipped.
 *   2. Subject-only match: the commit that fixed that had "[skip release]" in
 *      its own subject — v0.1.38 never shipped.
 *
 * The first two cases below are those exact commit messages. They are the
 * point of this file.
