# Run the Playwright-Electron suite without windows landing on your screen.
#
# There are two ways to be invisible and they are NOT equivalent in speed:
#
#   xvfb-run   The windows are ordinary mapped windows; they just render into a
#              virtual display instead of yours. Full speed. This is what CI
#              already does (.github/workflows/ci.yml).
#
#   unmapped   No display server required: the app leaves its windows unmapped
#              (electron/window-chrome.ts:hideWindowsForE2E). Chromium
#              deprioritizes rendering for a window that was never shown, so
#              the suite is correct but roughly 2-3x slower. This is also the
#              only option on macOS, which has no xvfb.
#
# So: use xvfb when it is installed, and inside it let the windows map normally.
# Install once on Debian/Ubuntu with:  sudo apt install xvfb
#
# PIDEX_E2E_SHOW=1 runs the suite on your real display, for when you actually
# want to watch it.
