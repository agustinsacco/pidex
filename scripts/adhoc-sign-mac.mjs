/**
 * `afterPack` hook: ad-hoc sign the macOS bundle when there is no Developer ID.
 *
 * Electron's prebuilt binary ships `linker-signed` with `Identifier=Electron`
 * and NO sealed resources. When electron-builder has no certificate it skips
 * signing entirely (`identity=null` skips it too — it does not ad-hoc sign),
 * so that stock signature is what shipped: v0.1.90's `.dmg` and `-mac.zip`
 * both failed `codesign --verify` with
 *
 *     code has no resources but signature indicates they must be present
 *
 * which Finder reports as "damaged and can't be opened". Dev never caught it
 * because `npm run dev` execs the binary directly — Gatekeeper only assesses
 * files carrying `com.apple.quarantine`, which a download has and an npm
 * tarball does not.
 *
 * `codesign --sign -` re-signs the bundle properly: identifier becomes
 * `works.pidex.app` and the resource seal is written, so the bundle verifies.
 * It is still ad-hoc — `spctl` says `rejected` rather than accepting it — but
 * "unsigned by anyone" is a normal right-click → Open, not a damaged app.
 *
 * Runs BEFORE the dmg/zip targets are cut, so both artifacts carry the fixed
 * signature. A no-op when a real certificate is present: electron-builder has
 * already signed and notarized by then, and re-signing ad-hoc would strip that.
 *
 * ## Why it pins an explicit designated requirement
 *
 * Left to itself, `codesign --sign -` derives the designated requirement from
 * the code hash: `designated => cdhash H"…"`. That hash changes with every
 * build. macOS privacy (TCC) stores that requirement alongside each grant and
 * re-checks it on the next launch, so after an auto-update the installed app
 * no longer satisfies the requirement recorded when the user clicked Allow —
 * and every folder prompt (Downloads, Documents, Desktop, …) comes back. This
 * repo ships a release on every green merge to main, so in practice the app
 * asked again more or less daily.
 *
 * `-r 'designated => identifier "<appId>"'` pins the requirement to the bundle
 * identifier instead, which is stable across builds, so a grant survives the
 * update. This does not weaken anything meaningful: an ad-hoc signature has no
 * anchor to bind to in the first place, and anyone able to replace the bundle
 * in /Applications can already re-sign it ad-hoc under any identifier. A real
 * Developer ID (the CSC_LINK path above) gets a stable team-anchored
 * requirement from electron-builder and never reaches this code.
 *
 * ## Why the requirement needs its OWN pass
 *
 * `-r` and `--deep` in one command produce a bundle that does not verify:
 *
 *     codesign --verify --deep --strict pidex.app
 *     pidex.app: nested code is modified or invalid
 *
 * `--deep` applies the requirement to every nested Helper and Framework as
 * well, and re-signing them after the enclosing seal was computed leaves the
 * parent sealing a binary that no longer matches (`file modified:
 * …/Electron Framework.framework/Versions/Current/Helpers/chrome_crashpad_handler`).
 * Shipped as one command in #156, it failed 100% of macOS release builds —
 * v0.1.172 and v0.1.174 both published Linux-only, no `.dmg`, no
 * `latest-mac.yml`.
 *
 * So: seal nested code first with no requirement of our own, then re-sign only
 * the OUTER bundle with `-r`. Signing outside-in is what Apple asks for anyway
 * — the outer signature seals the (already signed) nested code by hash, so the
 * second pass recomputes those seals rather than invalidating them. Nested
 * code keeps a per-build cdhash requirement, which is what it had before #156
 * and what TCC never looks at; only the app's own requirement is consulted.
