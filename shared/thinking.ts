/**
 * Which thinking levels a given model actually supports.
 *
 * Mirrors pi's `getSupportedThinkingLevels()` / `clampThinkingLevel()` from
 * @earendil-works/pi-ai (dist/models.js, verified against pi 0.84.1). pidex
 * never imports pi's code, so the algorithm is duplicated here and pinned by
 * unit tests — same contract as `shared/rpc.ts`.
 *
 * Why this exists: both pickers used to render one hardcoded six-item list
 * (`off…xhigh`) for every reasoning model. That list is correct for 3.2% of
 * pi's 1220 catalogued model records. The two failure modes it produced were
 * both silent:
 *
 *   - Offering a level the model lacks. Kimi K2.5 has `thinkingLevelMap: null`,
 *     so `xhigh` is unsupported; pi's `setThinkingLevel` clamps it to `high`
 *     without erroring. The chip then displayed "Xhigh" while the model ran at
 *     `high` — pidex reporting a setting the agent was not using.
 *   - Hiding `max` entirely. pi has seven levels; pidex's union had six, so
 *     `max`-capable models (98 records) could not reach their top level at all.
 *
 * A live session should prefer pi's own answer over this
 * (`get_available_thinking_levels`); this module is what makes the *home*
 * picker — which has no session to ask — agree with it rather than guess.
