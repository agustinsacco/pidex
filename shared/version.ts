/**
 * "Is there something newer than what is installed?" — one implementation,
 * used for both pi packages (Settings → Extensions) and pidex's own updater.
 *
 * Deliberately not a full semver comparison. Both callers ask the same narrow
 * question about plain dotted versions, and the only consumer of the answer is
 * whether to offer an Update affordance.
 *
 * There used to be two copies with different rules: the renderer's understood
 * prereleases but mapped an unparseable segment to `0`, and the main process's
 * dropped prereleases but refused to claim an update on malformed input. Each
 * was missing the other's protection. The union is what lives here:
 *
 * - a leading `v` is ignored, and missing trailing segments count as `0`
 * - segments compare **numerically**, so `0.1.10` beats `0.1.9` (string
 *   comparison here would have stranded every user on the ninth release)
 * - a prerelease sorts **below** the same plain release, so a `-dev` build
 *   never offers itself as an update to the version it was cut from
 * - anything unparseable answers `false`, because refusing to claim an update
 *   is always safer than inventing one
