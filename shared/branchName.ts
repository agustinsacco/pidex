 * A chat that starts with "Fix the composer autogrow jump" becomes the session

 * and the branch `pidex/composer-autogrow-fix` — one name in three places, so

 *
 * Folder and branch are derived together and deliberately differ: the prefix
 * contains a `/`, and a `/` in the folder name would nest the checkout a level

 *
 * Pure and side-effect free; the git calls live in `git-worktrees.ts`.
