 * spawns, reads the keychain or writes prefs lives in `accounts.ts`.
 *
 * Selection happens ONCE, when a session spawns. It cannot happen later: the
 * CLI process is parked for the life of the session (pi-claude-cli >= 0.7.0),
 * and its credential is fixed by the environment it was spawned with. So
 * "ordered" means *start* on the first account that is not exhausted, not fail
 * over mid-turn — a session that hits its limit is a session the user restarts.
