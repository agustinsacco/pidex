 * Single source of truth for pi's on-disk layout. Both the agent-settings
 * reader and the session scanner depend on the same env-var contract, so it
 * lives in one place rather than being restated per consumer.
 *
 * Layout (verified against the local install):
 *   ~/.pi/agent/sessions/--<cwd segments joined by dashes>--/<ts>_<uuid>.jsonl
 *
 * The Claude Code CLI's layout lives here too. A session on the
 * `pi-claude-cli` provider is written to disk TWICE — once by pi and once by
 * the CLI it shells out to — and the two harnesses mangle the same cwd
 * differently, so anything that has to find both ledgers needs both rules
 * side by side.
