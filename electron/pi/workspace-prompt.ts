/**
 * The `--append-system-prompt` block pidex adds for worktree sessions.
 *
 * pi already ends its system prompt with one `Current working directory: …`
 * line, and that line is correct. It is not enough: when the worktree sits
 * *inside* its own main checkout — which is exactly where pidex puts them,
 * `<repo>/.pidex/worktrees/<name>` — the cwd string contains the main
 * checkout as a prefix, and a model absolutising a relative path has been
 * observed to trim the `.pidex/worktrees/<name>` segment back off. The
 * shortened path exists and opens, so the mistake returns another branch's
 * code instead of an error (session 01a02ca0: one of two reads).
 *
 * So this says the part pi's line leaves implicit: the prefix is load-bearing
 * and the main checkout is a different branch. `pi-ext/worktree-paths.ts` is
 * the backstop that makes it loud when a model does it anyway.
 *
 * Nothing is appended for ordinary (non-worktree) sessions — pi's own line
 * already covers them, and every token here is spent on every request.
