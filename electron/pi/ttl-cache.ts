/**
 * A one-value cache with a TTL and in-flight dedupe.
 *
 * `pi:catalogueModels` spawns a whole `pi --mode rpc --no-session` process and
 * `pi:health` runs `pi --version`, and both were uncached: every model-picker
 * open cost two process spawns, and each renderer caller kept its own copy, so
 * remounting the home screen paid again. Neither answer changes between
 * spawns, so neither needs to be asked twice.
 *
 * Failures are NOT cached — a picker opened while pi was still installing must
 * be able to succeed on the next try rather than serve an error for the whole
 * TTL.
