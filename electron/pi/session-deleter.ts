/**
 * Deleting a session means deleting every ledger it wrote.
 *
 * A session on the `pi-claude-cli` provider is persisted twice: pi's own
 * transcript, and the Claude Code CLI's parallel copy under
 * ~/.claude/projects. Only the first was ever removed, so the CLI copy — much
 * the larger of the two, tens of megabytes for a long session — survived
 * every delete with nothing left pointing at it.
 *
 * Both go to the trash rather than being unlinked: a transcript is the only
 * record of a conversation, and "delete" in the sidebar should be as
 * recoverable as deleting a file in a file manager.
 *
 * The CLI copy is strictly best-effort. Its absence is the normal case for
 * every other provider and for sessions older than the provider itself, so a
 * miss is silent and never fails the delete.
 *
 * NOTE: plain readline is fine here for the same reason it is in
 * session-scanner — a persisted, LF-terminated file, parsed defensively.
