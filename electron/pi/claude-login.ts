/**
 * Signing the Claude Code CLI in and out from inside pidex.
 *
 * This is the account that bills a Claude Pro/Max plan (`pi-claude-cli`), and
 * until now pidex only *read* it — the tab told the user to go run `claude` in
 * a terminal and type `/login`. That is the one provider whose sign-in needs no
 * terminal at all, because unlike pi's `/login` (TUI-only, hence the pty
 * driver in `login-flow.ts`), `claude auth login` is a plain subcommand that
 * works with **piped stdio**. Verified against Claude Code 2.1.231:
 *
 *     $ printf 'code\n' | claude auth login
 *     Opening browser to sign in…
 *     If the browser didn't open, visit: https://claude.com/cai/oauth/authorize?…
 *     Paste code here if prompted > Invalid code. Please make sure the full code was copied.
 *
 * So there is no screen to classify and no keystrokes to time: read the URL off
 * stdout, let the user finish in their browser, write the code they paste back
 * into stdin. Three facts that shape the code below, all established by running
 * the real CLI:
 *
 * - **The CLI opens the browser itself.** pidex must not open it too, or the
 *   user gets two tabs and pastes the code from the stale one. The UI offers
 *   the URL as a fallback link instead.
 * - **A wrong code is not fatal.** The CLI prints `Invalid code.` and re-prompts
 *   with a *fresh* URL, so the flow returns to `awaiting-code` rather than
 *   failing — and the newest URL is the live one.
 * - **Its prose is not the outcome.** A run given a bogus code still printed
 *   `Login successful.` and exited 0. Completion is therefore decided by
 *   `claude auth status`, the same fact the rest of pidex already trusts, never
 *   by matching output. (Same principle as `login-flow.ts`.)
