/**
 * The regression this file exists for: a watcher pointed at a session
 * directory that does not exist yet is born dead. chokidar does not poll for a
 * missing watch target — it reports nothing watched and never fires, even once
 * the path appears — and a brand-new worktree is always in exactly that state,
 * because pi has not written its first session file yet. The symptom was a
 * chat whose sidebar row stayed a context-menu-less placeholder (right-click
 * did nothing) until an unrelated re-render happened to re-scan the folder.
