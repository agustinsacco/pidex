/**
 * Session baseline: a commit-ish capturing the exact worktree at session
 * start WITHOUT touching the working directory, the index, or HEAD.
 * Returns null for non-repos.
 *
 * This used to be `git stash create`, which **silently omits untracked
 * files**. Untracked files are exactly the class that was unrecoverable when
 * two concurrent sessions collided in one tree (specs/TRACKER.md:114 — one agent ran
 * `git add -A && commit` and discarded the rest; a component and an extracted
 * module were rebuilt from scratch). So the product's own undo did not cover
 * the loss it was written for.
 *
 * The replacement stages into a throwaway index and writes a real tree:
 *
 *   read-tree HEAD → add -A → write-tree → commit-tree
 *
 * Two things are load-bearing.
 *
 * 1. `GIT_INDEX_FILE` must live OUTSIDE the worktree. Point it inside and
 *    `git add -A` captures the index file into the tree it is indexing.
 * 2. The identity is forced in the env. `commit-tree` fails outright on a
 *    machine with no `user.email` configured, and a baseline that only works
 *    on configured machines is worse than none.
 *
 * `add -A` honours `.gitignore`, so `node_modules` and build output stay out;
 * this captures untracked *source*, which is the point.
 *
 * Lifetime is unchanged from the stash version: the commit is a loose object
 * nothing references, so it survives until a `git gc` prune (default two
 * weeks), which comfortably outlives a session.
