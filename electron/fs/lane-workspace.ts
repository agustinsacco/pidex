/**
 * Where a lane started by the main process should run.
 *
 * A lane is one unit of work: one charter, one branch, one worktree, one agent
 * process. The branch is not a nicety — it is the only thing that makes two
 * lanes safe in one repo. The incident is in this repo's own log: two agent
 * sessions in one tree, one ran `git add -A && commit` and discarded the rest,
 * and the untracked files were unrecoverable (docs/specs/TRACKER.md:114).
 *
 * This exists because that isolation lived **entirely in the renderer**
 * (`src/features/sessions/startChat.ts`), so any main-side caller that passed
 * a bare `workspacePath` to `spawnSession` landed the agent in the main
 * checkout on whatever branch happened to be out.
 *
 * Degrades the way the renderer's path does, and for the same reason: a git
 * refusal must never stop a lane from starting. It returns the original folder
 * with a stated `warning`, and the caller is expected to surface it.
