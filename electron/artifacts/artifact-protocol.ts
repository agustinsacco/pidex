/**
 * Serving model-authored HTML on its own origin, so it can run JavaScript
 * without inheriting — or weakening — the app's Content Security Policy.
 *
 * ## Why a custom scheme, and not srcdoc / blob: / data:
 *
 * The artifact panel renders HTML in `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts">`. That
 * looked like it permitted scripts and did not: a `srcdoc` document INHERITS
 * the embedder's policy container, and `src/index.html` sets
 * `script-src 'self'`, so every inline script was refused and the sandbox
 * attribute was a no-op. Measured on Electron 43:
 *
 *     Executing inline script violates the following Content Security Policy
 *     directive 'script-src 'self''. The action has been blocked.
 *
 * `blob:` and `data:` do not help — HTML treats them as local schemes and they
 * inherit the same way. Only a real, non-local scheme gets its own policy, so
 * the document has to be *served* rather than embedded.
 *
 * ## Why this is tighter than what it replaces
 *
 * The response below carries `default-src 'none'`, and the iframe keeps
 * `sandbox="allow-scripts"` WITHOUT `allow-same-origin`, which makes the
 * document's security origin opaque. Verified end-to-end under Electron 43:
 *
 * | vector                          | result             |
 * | ------------------------------- | ------------------ |
 * | `window.origin`                 | `"null"` (opaque)  |
 * | `localStorage`, `document.cookie` | `SecurityError`  |
 * | parent DOM, sibling artifact DOM  | `SecurityError`  |
 * | `top.location =`                | `SecurityError`    |
 * | `fetch`, `sendBeacon`, `WebSocket` | blocked by CSP  |
 * | remote `<img>`                  | blocked by CSP     |
 *
 * So an artifact gains scripting and loses ALL network reach. Under the old
 * inherited policy it had `connect-src 'self' ws:` — it simply had no way to
 * use it. Net, this is a reduction in what model-authored HTML can do.
 *
 * `sendBeacon` returning `true` and `new WebSocket()` not throwing are both
 * false negatives when probing this: the request is queued and refused
 * asynchronously. Trust the console violations, not the return values.
 */

/**
 * The policy every artifact document is served with.
 *
 * `form-action` matters as much as `connect-src` here: a form POST is a
 * NAVIGATION, so `default-src`/`connect-src` do not cover it, and it would be
 * an exfiltration channel that none of the fetch-shaped tests would catch.
