/**
 * Make node-pty's `spawn-helper` executable before the first PTY spawn.
 *
 * On POSIX, node-pty execs a tiny `spawn-helper` binary that sits next to the
 * native module it loaded. Its loader (`lib/utils.js`) tries
 * `build/Release` → `build/Debug` → `prebuilds/<platform>-<arch>` and takes
 * the first `pty.node` that `require()` accepts — so which directory the
 * helper is looked up in depends on which native build actually loaded.
 *
 * That is the trap: on Apple Silicon, a locally compiled `build/Release`
 * (which can easily be x86_64 — npm running under Rosetta, a mismatched
 * `electron-builder install-app-deps`) fails to load in an arm64 Electron and
 * the loader silently falls back to the shipped `prebuilds/darwin-arm64`,
 * whose `spawn-helper` npm unpacks as 0644. Missing the exec bit, every
 * `pty.spawn` throws `posix_spawnp failed.` — the terminal pane's shell never
 * starts, and nothing about the error says "chmod".
 *
 * Repairing every candidate directory (not just the one that loaded) is
 * deliberate: it is a single stat per path, and it keeps working if the arch
 * mismatch is fixed later and the loader starts preferring `build/Release`.
 * Best-effort by design — a packaged app on read-only media cannot chmod, and
 * a failure here must surface as the spawn error, not as a boot crash.
