/**
 * On-disk debug log for the main process.
 *
 * Written because a real debugging session had nothing to work from. Every
 * `pi-claude-cli` turn was failing with `Error: Claude CLI returned success`,
 * a message that is self-contradictory and names no cause. The actual reason
 * (`API Error: Effort 'max' isn't available with thinking turned off`) existed
 * only inside the Claude CLI's own transcript under `~/.claude/projects/`.
 * pidex had already received the failing turn and kept nothing: pi's stderr
 * was forwarded to the renderer and dropped, and the app wrote no log at all.
 * Reconstructing it took shimming the `claude` binary to capture argv.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free and always-on. A log that must be enabled first
 * is never on when the bug happens — the failure has already occurred by the
 * time anyone thinks to look. Cost is bounded by size-capped rotation.
 *
 * NOT for the renderer: it is sandboxed and has no disk access by design.
 * Renderer-side problems surface through DevTools.
